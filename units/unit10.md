- Advise on pricing strategy

### Seller's Decision:
- **Seller sets listing price**, not broker
- Broker cannot guarantee selling price
- Price affects marketability and time on market

## Commission

### How Commission is Earned:
- Usually when **ready, willing, and able buyer** found
- Buyer at listing price and terms, OR
- Buyer at any price/terms seller accepts

### When Commission is Paid:
- Typically at closing when sale funds distributed
- Even if earned earlier (when offer accepted)

### Commission Splits:

**Between Brokers** (if cooperating sale):
- Listing broker and selling broker
- Split specified in MLS (commonly 50/50)
- Example: 6% total, 3% to each broker

**Within Brokerage**:
- Between broker and salesperson
- Per employment agreement
- Varies widely (50/50 to 95/5)

### Commission Calculation Formula:

**Commission = Sales Price × Commission Rate**

**Examples**:

1. **Simple Commission**:
   - Sales price: $300,000
   - Rate: 6% (0.06)
   - Commission: $300,000 × 0.06 = **$18,000**

2. **Agent's Share**:
   - Total commission: $18,000
   - Split with cooperating broker: 50/50 = $9,000
   - Agent's split with own broker: 60/40
   - Agent receives: $9,000 × 0.60 = **$5,400**

3. **Commission with Multiple Splits**:
   - Sales price: $250,000
   - Commission rate: 5.5%
   - Total commission: $250,000 × 0.055 = $13,750
   - Listing side: $13,750 × 0.50 = $6,875
   - Listing agent (70% split): $6,875 × 0.70 = **$4,812.50**

## Commission Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Commission
**Property sells for $450,000 at 5% commission**
- $450,000 × 0.05 = **$22,500 total commission**

### Example 2: Co-Op Split
**$450,000 sale, 6% commission, 50/50 split with cooperating broker**
- Total: $450,000 × 0.06 = $27,000
- Each broker: $27,000 × 0.50 = **$13,500**

### Example 3: Agent's Share
**$350,000 sale, 6% commission, 50/50 broker split, agent has 65% split**
- Total commission: $350,000 × 0.06 = $21,000
- Listing side: $21,000 × 0.50 = $10,500
- Agent's share: $10,500 × 0.65 = **$6,825**

### Example 4: Finding Sales Price from Commission
**Commission earned: $15,000 at 5% rate. What was sales price?**
- Sales Price = Commission ÷ Rate
- $15,000 ÷ 0.05 = **$300,000**

### Example 5: Finding Commission Rate
**$400,000 sale, $20,000 commission. What was rate?**
- Rate = Commission ÷ Sales Price
- $20,000 ÷ $400,000 = 0.05 = **5%**

---

## Key Formulas

### Commission Calculations:
- **Commission** = Sales Price × Rate
- **Sales Price** = Commission ÷ Rate
- **Rate** = Commission ÷ Sales Price

### Split Calculations:
- **Agent's Share** = Commission × Split Percentage
- **With Multiple Splits**: Commission × Split 1 × Split 2

### Remember:
- Always convert percentages to decimals
- Work through splits one at a time
- Show your work
- Check if answer makes sense
