**Pages: 123-136** (Heavy Math Section)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand financing options, loan types, and calculations
- Learn about primary and secondary mortgage markets
- Master conventional, FHA, and VA loans
- Calculate interest rates, loan terms, and monthly payments
- Understand amortization, points, and loan origination fees

---

## Key Concepts

### Mortgage vs. Deed of Trust

**Mortgage** (Title Theory States):
- Lender holds legal title
- Borrower has equitable title
- Two parties: mortgagor (borrower) and mortgagee (lender)
- Foreclosure through court (judicial)

**Deed of Trust** (Lien Theory States):
- Borrower holds title
- Lien against property
- Three parties: trustor (borrower), beneficiary (lender), trustee (holds naked title)
- Faster foreclosure (non-judicial)

**Note**: Promissory note accompanies either mortgage or deed of trust

---

## Key Terminology

**Mortgagor**: Borrower (gives the mortgage)
**Mortgagee**: Lender (receives the mortgage)

**Trustor**: Borrower (in deed of trust)
**Beneficiary**: Lender (in deed of trust)
**Trustee**: Third party holding title (in deed of trust)

**Hypothecation**: Pledge property as collateral while retaining possession

**Equity**: Owner's interest in property (value minus debt)
- Formula: **Equity = Market Value - Loan Balance**

---

## Components of Monthly Payment: PITI

**P** = Principal (loan amount repayment)
**I** = Interest (cost of borrowing)
**T** = Taxes (property taxes)
**I** = Insurance (homeowners insurance)

**Note**: Some also include PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) and HOA fees

---

## Types of Loans

### By Guarantee/Insurance:

#### 1. Conventional Loans

**Not government-backed**:
- Conforming: Meet Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac standards
- Non-conforming: Don't meet secondary market standards
- Jumbo loans: Exceed conforming loan limits

**Down Payment**:
- Traditionally 20%
- Less than 20% requires PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)

**PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)**:
- Protects lender if borrower defaults
- Required when LTV > 80%
- Can be canceled when equity reaches 20-22%
- Borrower pays premium

#### 2. FHA Loans (Federal Housing Administration)

**Government-insured (not government-funded)**:
- Low down payment (as low as 3.5%)
- More lenient credit requirements
- FHA insures lender against loss
- Borrower pays insurance premium (MIP)
- Property must meet FHA standards
- Loan limits vary by area

**MIP (Mortgage Insurance Premium)**:
- Upfront premium (can be financed)
- Annual premium (monthly payments)
- Required for life of loan if down payment < 10%

#### 3. VA Loans (Department of Veterans Affairs)

**Government-guaranteed**:
- **No down payment** possible (100% financing)
- No PMI required
- Competitive interest rates
- For eligible veterans and service members
- **Certificate of Eligibility** required
- **VA funding fee** (can be financed)
- Property must meet VA requirements

**Entitlement**: Guarantee amount available to veteran

### By Amortization:

#### Fully Amortized Loan

**Level payments throughout loan life**:
- Same payment amount each month
- Each payment includes principal and interest
- Early payments mostly interest
- Later payments mostly principal
- Loan fully paid at end of term
- **Most common type**

#### Partially Amortized (Balloon Payment)

**Not fully paid by end of term**:
- Lower payments during term
- Large balloon payment due at end
- Entire balance due at specified date
- Risky for borrower

#### Interest-Only Loan

**Payments cover only interest**:
- Principal not reduced
- Entire principal due at end
- Lower monthly payments
- High risk

#### Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)

**Interest rate changes periodically**:
- Initial rate (often lower than fixed)
- Adjustment periods (e.g., annually)
- Index (basis for rate changes)
- Margin (lender's profit added to index)
- Caps (limits on rate changes)
  - Periodic cap (per adjustment)
  - Lifetime cap (over life of loan)

**Components**:
- Index + Margin = Interest Rate
- Common indexes: LIBOR, Treasury bills, COFI

**Example ARM notation: 5/1 ARM**:
- Fixed for first 5 years
- Adjusts annually after that

---

## Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)

**Formula**: **LTV = Loan Amount ÷ Property Value (or Sale Price)**

**Examples**:
- $180,000 loan on $200,000 property
- LTV = $180,000 ÷ $200,000 = 0.90 = **90% LTV**

**Down payment = 100% - LTV**
- 90% LTV = 10% down payment
- 80% LTV = 20% down payment

**High LTV = Higher risk = May require PMI**

---

## Points (Discount Points)

**1 Point = 1% of Loan Amount**

**Purpose**: Buy down interest rate

**Formula**: **Points in Dollars = Loan Amount × (Points ÷ 100)**

**Examples**:

1. **2 points on $150,000 loan**:
   - $150,000 × 0.02 = **$3,000**

2. **3.5 points on $280,000 loan**:
   - $280,000 × 0.035 = **$9,800**

**General Rule**: Each point lowers rate by approximately 0.25%

**Tax Treatment**: Points may be tax-deductible

---

## Amortization

**Amortization**: Gradual loan payoff through periodic payments

### How It Works:
- Each payment includes principal and interest
- Early in loan: Mostly interest
- Later in loan: Mostly principal
- Total payment stays the same (fixed-rate loans)

### Amortization Schedules:
- Show each payment breakdown
- Principal portion increases over time
- Interest portion decreases over time
- Running balance shown

---

## Interest Calculations

### Simple Interest Formula:
**Interest = Principal × Rate × Time**

### Annual Interest:
**Annual Interest = Loan Balance × Interest Rate**

**Example**:
- Loan: $200,000
- Rate: 6% (0.06)
- Annual Interest: $200,000 × 0.06 = **$12,000**

### Monthly Interest:
**Monthly Interest = (Loan Balance × Rate) ÷ 12**

**Example**:
- $200,000 loan at 6%
- Monthly Interest: ($200,000 × 0.06) ÷ 12 = **$1,000**

---

## Monthly Payment Calculations

### Using Amortization Factor Tables:

**Formula**: **Monthly Payment = Loan Amount × Factor**

**Factor** = from amortization table based on rate and term

**Example from Unit 12 (Page 136)**:
- Loan: $125,000
- Rate: 6.68%
- Factor: 0.00868 (from table)
- Monthly Payment: $125,000 × 0.00868 = **$1,085**

### Total Paid Over Life of Loan:

**Total Payments = Monthly Payment × Number of Payments**

**Example**:
- Monthly payment: $1,085
- 30-year loan = 360 payments
- Total: $1,085 × 360 = **$390,600**

### Total Interest Paid:

**Total Interest = Total Payments - Original Loan Amount**

**Example**:
- Total payments: $390,600
- Original loan: $125,000
- Total interest: $390,600 - $125,000 = **$265,600**

---

## 15-Year vs. 30-Year Loans

**30-Year Loan**:
- Lower monthly payment
- More total interest paid
- Takes longer to build equity

**15-Year Loan**:
- Higher monthly payment
- Significantly less total interest
- Builds equity faster
- Own home sooner

**Example from Page 136**:
- Loan: $125,000 at 6.68%
- 30-year: $1,085/month, $265,600 total interest
- 15-year: Higher monthly payment, much less total interest

---

## Primary vs. Secondary Mortgage Markets

### Primary Market:
- Where loans are originated
- Direct lender-borrower relationship
- Examples: Banks, credit unions, mortgage companies
- Create new loans

### Secondary Market:
- Where loans are bought and sold
- Provides liquidity to primary market
- Major players:
  - **Fannie Mae (FNMA)**: Federal National Mortgage Association
  - **Freddie Mac (FHLMC)**: Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
  - **Ginnie Mae (GNMA)**: Government National Mortgage Association

**Process**:
1. Lender originates loan (primary market)
2. Lender sells loan to secondary market
3. Loans pooled into mortgage-backed securities
4. Frees lender's capital for new loans

---

## Qualifying Buyers

### Debt-to-Income Ratios (DTI):

**Housing Expense Ratio (Front-End Ratio)**:
- PITI ÷ Gross Monthly Income
- Typically ≤ 28%

**Total Debt Ratio (Back-End Ratio)**:
- (PITI + Other Debt) ÷ Gross Monthly Income
- Typically ≤ 36-43%

**Example**:
- Gross monthly income: $6,000
- Maximum housing: $6,000 × 0.28 = **$1,680**
- Maximum total debt: $6,000 × 0.36 = **$2,160**

## Practice Math Problems (Pages 131, 136)

### Problem Types:
1. Monthly payment calculations
2. Total interest over life of loan
3. 15-year vs 30-year comparisons
4. LTV calculations
5. Points calculations
6. Maximum loan amount from income
7. Interest calculations

### Sample Problem (Page 136):
**Lowest borrowing period calculation**:
- $25,000 ÷ $200 ÷ 1,000 = **125 years**

---

## Study Tips for Unit 12

1. **Memorize key formulas** - LTV, points, interest
2. **Practice payment calculations** - Use factor tables
3. **Understand 15 vs. 30-year** - Payment vs. total interest tradeoff
4. **Know loan types** - Conventional, FHA, VA differences
5. **Master point calculations** - 1 point = 1% of loan amount

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Confusing mortgagor and mortgagee (borrower vs. lender)
❌ Forgetting to convert percentage to decimal
❌ Mixing up LTV formula (loan ÷ value, not value ÷ loan)
❌ Calculating points wrong (multiply loan × points, not value)
❌ Confusing annual and monthly interest
❌ Thinking FHA/VA are lenders (they insure/guarantee, don't lend)

---

## Key Formulas

### Loan-to-Value:
**LTV = Loan Amount ÷ Property Value**

### Points:
**Points $ = Loan Amount × (Points ÷ 100)**

### Interest:
**Annual Interest = Loan Balance × Rate**
**Monthly Interest = (Loan Balance × Rate) ÷ 12**

### Monthly Payment:
**Payment = Loan Amount × Amortization Factor**

### Total Interest:
**Total Interest = (Monthly Payment × # Payments) - Loan Amount**

### Equity:
**Equity = Market Value - Loan Balance**
