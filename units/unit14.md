## Prorations

- Based on time each party owns property
- Can be daily or monthly basis

**Most Common Prorations**:
- Property taxes
- HOA dues
- Utilities (if applicable)
- Rents (if property rented)
- Prepaid items

### Proration Methods

**365-Day Method** (Most Common):
- Annual amount ÷ 365 = daily rate
- Daily rate × number of days = prorated amount

**30-Day Month / 360-Day Year**:
- Each month = 30 days
- Year = 360 days
- Simpler calculation

### Who Pays for Day of Closing?

**Varies by location**:
- Some areas: Seller pays
- Some areas: Buyer pays
- Some areas: Split
- **Check local custom!**

### Proration Examples

**Example 1: Property Tax Proration**
- Annual taxes: $3,650
- Closing: July 15
- Seller owns Jan 1 - July 14 = 195 days
- Daily rate: $3,650 ÷ 365 = $10/day
- Seller's portion: $10 × 195 = **$1,950**

**Example 2: Prepaid Taxes**
- Seller paid full year: $2,400
- Closing: September 1
- Buyer owns Sept 1 - Dec 31 = 122 days
- Daily rate: $2,400 ÷ 365 = $6.58/day
- Buyer owes seller: $6.58 × 122 = **$802.76**
- **Credit to seller, debit to buyer**

**Example 3: Rent Proration** (Rental Property)
- Monthly rent: $1,500
- Tenant paid for full month
- Closing: June 18
- Buyer owns June 18-30 = 13 days
- Daily rate: $1,500 ÷ 30 = $50/day
- Buyer receives: $50 × 13 = **$650**
- **Credit to buyer, debit to seller**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Confusing debits and credits

❌ Miscounting days in proration
❌ Thinking HUD-1 still used (now Closing Disclosure)
❌ Mixing up owner's and lender's title insurance
❌ Wrong calculation direction in prorations

---

## Key Formulas

### Prorations:
**Daily Rate = Annual Amount ÷ 365**
**Proration Amount = Daily Rate × Number of Days**

### Transfer Tax Example:
**Tax = (Sales Price ÷ Base Amount) × Rate per Base**

### Prepaid Interest:
**Interest = Loan Amount × Rate ÷ 365 × Days**

## Debit/Credit Rules

### Buyer's Side:
- **Debits**: Purchase price, loan costs, prepaid items, buyer's closing costs
- **Credits**: Earnest money, loan amount, seller credits, prorated items seller owes

### Seller's Side:
