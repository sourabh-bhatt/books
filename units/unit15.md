## Property Taxes

### Overview

**Property Tax**: Ad valorem tax on real estate
- **Ad valorem**: According to value
- Primary revenue source for local governments
- Funds schools, police, fire, roads, services
- Annual tax based on assessed value

### How Property Taxes Work

**Assessment**:
- Property appraised by tax assessor
- Assessed value determined
- May be percentage of market value

**Tax Rate**:
- Set by taxing authorities
- Expressed as:
  - **Mills**: 1 mill = $1 per $1,000 of value
  - **Percentage**: Per $100 of value
  - **Dollar amount**: Per $1,000 of value

**Tax Calculation**:
- Assessed Value × Tax Rate = Annual Tax

---

## Property Tax Calculations

### Method 1: Mill Rate

**1 Mill = $0.001 or $1 per $1,000**

**Formula**: **Tax = (Assessed Value ÷ 1,000) × Mill Rate**

**Example**:
- Assessed value: $250,000
- Tax rate: 45 mills
- Tax: ($250,000 ÷ 1,000) × 45 = **$11,250**

**Alternative**: **Tax = Assessed Value × (Mills ÷ 1,000)**
- $250,000 × (45 ÷ 1,000) = $250,000 × 0.045 = **$11,250**

### Method 2: Rate per $100

**Formula**: **Tax = (Assessed Value ÷ 100) × Rate**

**Example**:
- Assessed value: $200,000
- Rate: $3.50 per $100
- Tax: ($200,000 ÷ 100) × $3.50 = **$7,000**

### Method 3: Percentage Rate

**Formula**: **Tax = Assessed Value × Tax Rate**

**Example**:
- Assessed value: $300,000
- Tax rate: 2.5% (0.025)
- Tax: $300,000 × 0.025 = **$7,500**

### Assessment Ratio

**Assessed Value = Market Value × Assessment Ratio**

**Example**:
- Market value: $400,000
- Assessment ratio: 80%
- Assessed value: $400,000 × 0.80 = **$320,000**

**Then calculate tax**:
- If rate is 25 mills:
- Tax: ($320,000 ÷ 1,000) × 25 = **$8,000**

## Special Assessments

### What is a Special Assessment?

**Special Assessment**: Tax for specific improvement benefiting property

---

## Types of Liens

### General vs. Specific Liens

**General Lien**:
- Attaches to ALL property owned
- Not limited to one property
- Examples: Judgment liens, IRS tax liens

**Specific Lien**:
- Attaches to particular property only
- Examples: Mortgage, property tax lien, mechanic's lien

---

## Classification of Liens

### 1. Voluntary Liens

**Created by property owner's action**:

**Mortgage/Deed of Trust**:
- Borrower voluntarily pledges property
- Secures loan
- Most common voluntary lien

**Vendor's Lien**:
- Seller's lien for unpaid purchase price
- Arises from deed

### 2. Involuntary Liens

**Imposed without owner's consent**:

**Property Tax Lien**:
- Unpaid property taxes
- Statutory lien
- **Highest priority** (superior to all others)
- Can result in tax sale

**Special Assessment Lien**:
- Unpaid special assessments
- Very high priority
- Usually second only to property taxes

**Mechanic's Lien**:
- Unpaid contractor/supplier
- For labor or materials
- Must file within time limit
- **Priority**: Dates back to start of work (not filing date)
- Also called: Construction lien, materialman's lien

**Judgment Lien**:
- Court judgment for debt
- General lien (all property)
- Priority from date of recording
- Good for specified period (varies by state)

**IRS Tax Lien**:
- Unpaid federal income taxes
- General lien
- Priority from assessment date
- Can attach to all assets

**State/Local Tax Liens**:
- Unpaid income or other taxes
- Similar to IRS liens

**HOA Lien**:
- Unpaid homeowners association dues
- Can foreclose in most states
- Priority varies by state

## Lien Priority

### General Priority Rules

**Basic Rule**: "First in time, first in right"
- Earlier recorded liens have priority
- Later liens are subordinate

**Exceptions** (These Always Have Priority):
1. **Property tax liens** (first position always)
2. **Special assessment liens** (second usually)
3. **Mechanic's liens** (date from start of work, not filing)

### Priority Order (Typical):

1. Property taxes
2. Special assessments
3. First mortgage (if recorded first)
4. Second mortgage
5. Judgment liens
6. Other liens (by recording date)

**Exception**: Mechanic's lien may take priority over mortgage if work started before mortgage recorded

### Subordination Agreement

**Voluntary change in priority**:
- Senior lienholder agrees to subordinate
- Junior lien moves up in priority
- Must be in writing
- Common in construction financing

---

## Foreclosure and Lien Satisfaction

### Foreclosure

**Process to enforce lien**:
- Legal proceeding
- Property sold to satisfy debt
- Proceeds distributed by priority

**Distribution of Foreclosure Sale Proceeds**:
1. Costs of sale
2. Property taxes
3. Special assessments
4. Foreclosing lien
5. Junior liens (in order)
6. Owner (any surplus)

**Effect on Other Liens**:
- Liens superior to foreclosing lien remain
- Liens junior to foreclosing lien are wiped out
- Junior lienholders lose interest

**Example**:
- First mortgage forecloses
- Property tax lien survives (superior)
- Second mortgage wiped out (junior)
- Judgment lien wiped out (junior)

### Lien Release/Satisfaction

**Removing a lien**:
- Payment in full
- Satisfaction/release document
- Must be recorded
- Clears title

**Satisfaction of Mortgage**:
- When loan paid off
- Lender provides release
- Must be recorded
- Removes lien

## Practice Materials

### Common Math Problems:
- Calculate annual property tax
- Convert mill rates
- Apply assessment ratios
- Calculate homestead exemption savings
- Prorate property taxes

### Example Problems:

**Problem 1**:
- Market value: $350,000
- Assessment ratio: 75%
- Tax rate: 40 mills
- Calculate annual tax

**Solution**:
- Assessed value: $350,000 × 0.75 = $262,500
- Tax: ($262,500 ÷ 1,000) × 40 = **$10,500**

**Problem 2**:
- Assessed value: $180,000
- Tax rate: $2.50 per $100
- Homestead exemption: $25,000
- Calculate annual tax

**Solution**:
- Taxable value: $180,000 - $25,000 = $155,000
- Tax: ($155,000 ÷ 100) × $2.50 = **$3,875**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Forgetting to apply assessment ratio before calculating tax
❌ Confusing general and specific liens
❌ Thinking all liens follow "first in time" rule (taxes are always first!)
❌ Mixing up mill rate formula (÷ 1,000, not × 1,000)
❌ Forgetting mechanic's lien priority dates from start of work
❌ Subtracting exemption from tax instead of assessed value

---

## Key Formulas

### Property Tax:
**Tax = (Assessed Value ÷ 1,000) × Mill Rate**

Or:
**Tax = Assessed Value × (Rate ÷ 100)** [if rate per $100]

### With Assessment Ratio:
**Assessed Value = Market Value × Assessment Ratio**
**Then calculate tax on assessed value**

### With Exemption:
**Taxable Value = Assessed Value - Exemption**
**Then calculate tax on taxable value**
