## Appraisal Basics

### What is an Appraisal?

**Appraisal**: Professional opinion of property value
- Based on analysis and training
- Follows systematic process
- Supported by data and reasoning
- Prepared by licensed/certified appraiser

**Purpose of Appraisals**:
- Determine market value for sale
- Secure financing (lender requirement)
- Property tax assessment
- Estate settlement
- Condemnation proceedings
- Insurance coverage
- Investment analysis

---

## Types of Value

### Market Value ⭐ (Most Important)

**Market Value**: Most probable price property will bring
- Willing buyer and willing seller
- Both knowledgeable and acting without pressure
- Reasonable time on market
- Payment in cash or equivalent
- Arms-length transaction

**Also called**: Fair market value

### Other Types of Value

**Assessed Value**:
- For property tax purposes
- May differ from market value
- Set by tax assessor

**Insured Value**:
- For insurance coverage
- May not include land
- Replacement cost focus

**Investment Value**:
- Value to particular investor
- Based on investor's goals
- May differ from market value

**Liquidation Value**:
- Quick sale value
- Usually below market value
- Forced sale situation

**Rental/Income Value**:
- Based on income generation
- For investment properties

## Principles of Value

### Supply and Demand

**Value affected by**:
- Available properties (supply)
- Buyer demand
- Market equilibrium
- Scarcity increases value

### Substitution ⭐

**Most important principle**:
- Maximum value = cost of equally desirable substitute
- Buyer won't pay more than cost of comparable property
- Foundation for sales comparison approach

### Conformity

**Maximum value when property conforms to area**:
- Similar size, style, age
- Fits neighborhood
- Not over-improved or under-improved

**Related concepts**:
- **Regression**: Better property pulled down by lesser properties
- **Progression**: Lesser property pulled up by better properties

### Highest and Best Use ⭐

**Use producing greatest value**:
- Legally permissible
- Physically possible
- Financially feasible
- Maximally productive

**Example**: Vacant lot in commercial area
- Highest and best use: Commercial development
- Not: Residential use

### Contribution

**Value of improvement = what it contributes to total value**:
- Not cost of improvement
- Extra bedroom may add $20,000 value even if cost $30,000
- Swimming pool may not add full cost to value

### Anticipation

**Value based on expected future benefits**:
- Future income
- Appreciation potential
- Area development

### Change

**Real estate constantly affected by change**:
- Economic conditions
- Social trends
- Government regulations
- Environmental factors
- **No property immune to change**

### Competition

**Success breeds competition**:
- Profitable ventures attract others
- Eventually reduces profits
- Affects commercial property values

### Plottage (Assemblage)

**Combining parcels increases value**:
- Merged lots may be worth more than sum
- Larger parcel may have better use
- Example: Two 50-ft lots = $100k each; combined 100-ft lot = $225k

## Three Approaches to Value

### 1. Sales Comparison Approach ⭐

**Most common for residential property**

**Process**:
1. Find recent sales of comparable properties
2. Adjust for differences
3. Estimate value

**Comparables (Comps)**:
- Similar properties recently sold
- Same neighborhood if possible
- Similar size, age, condition
- Sold within last 6 months ideally

**Adjustments**:
- Add value if comp is inferior
- Subtract value if comp is superior
- **Adjust COMP to SUBJECT**, not vice versa

**Formula**: **Subject value = Comp sale price ± Adjustments**

**Adjustment Factors**:
- Location
- Size (square footage)
- Age and condition
- Features (garage, pool, etc.)
- Date of sale
- Terms of sale

**Example**:
- Comp sold for: $300,000
- Comp has pool (+$10,000), subject doesn't
- Subject has extra bedroom (+$15,000), comp doesn't
- Comp is superior (pool), so subtract: $300,000 - $10,000 = $290,000
- Subject is superior (bedroom), so add: $290,000 + $15,000 = **$305,000 estimated value**

**Remember**: **CBS**
- **C**omp Better, **S**ubtract
- **C**omp Worse, **A**dd (CWA)

### 2. Cost Approach

**Value = Land Value + Improvement Value - Depreciation**

**Best for**:
- New construction
- Special purpose properties
- Insurance valuations
- Properties lacking comparables

**Process**:
1. Estimate land value (as if vacant)
2. Estimate replacement/reproduction cost of improvements
3. Subtract accrued depreciation
4. Add land and depreciated improvement value

**Replacement Cost**: Cost to build functionally equivalent structure
**Reproduction Cost**: Cost to build exact replica

**Formula**:
**Value = Land Value + (Replacement Cost - Depreciation)**

**Example**:
- Land value: $100,000
- Replacement cost of house: $250,000
- Total depreciation: $50,000
- Value: $100,000 + ($250,000 - $50,000) = **$300,000**

---

### 3. Income Approach

**Value based on income property generates**

**Best for**:
- Investment/rental properties
- Commercial properties
- Apartment buildings
- Office buildings

**Key Formula**: **Value = Net Operating Income ÷ Capitalization Rate**

**Or**: **V = I ÷ R**

**Net Operating Income (NOI)**:
- Gross income
- Minus vacancy and collection losses
- Minus operating expenses
- **Does NOT include** debt service (mortgage payments)

**Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)**:
- Rate of return investor expects
- Derived from market
- Higher cap rate = higher risk = lower value

**Example**:
- Annual NOI: $50,000
- Cap rate: 8% (0.08)
- Value: $50,000 ÷ 0.08 = **$625,000**

**Related Formulas**:
- **I = V × R** (Income = Value × Rate)
- **R = I ÷ V** (Rate = Income ÷ Value)

### Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)

**Simpler income method for residential**:

**Formula**: **Value = Gross Monthly Rent × GRM**

**Or**: **GRM = Sale Price ÷ Gross Monthly Rent**

**Process**:
1. Find GRM from comparable sales
2. Apply to subject property's rent

**Example**:
**Finding GRM from comp**:
- Comp sold for: $240,000
- Monthly rent: $2,000
- GRM: $240,000 ÷ $2,000 = **120**

**Applying GRM to subject**:
- Subject monthly rent: $2,100
- Using GRM of 120
- Estimated value: $2,100 × 120 = **$252,000**

**Note**: GRM uses **gross** rent (before expenses)

## Depreciation (in Cost Approach)

**Depreciation**: Loss in value from any cause

**Three Types**:

### 1. Physical Deterioration

**Wear and tear from use and age**:
- Normal aging
- Deferred maintenance
- Damage

**Two Categories**:
- **Curable**: Cost to repair less than value added
  - Example: Worn carpet, peeling paint
- **Incurable**: Cost to repair exceeds value added
  - Example: Foundation issues, old systems

### 2. Functional Obsolescence

**Design defects or outdated features**:
- Poor floor plan
- Outdated style
- Inadequate systems
- Too few bathrooms
- Too many/few bedrooms for area

**Curable**:
- Economical to fix
- Example: Outdated fixtures

**Incurable**:
- Not economical to fix
- Example: Poor room layout, high ceilings (energy waste)

### 3. External (Economic) Obsolescence

**Outside forces reducing value**:
- Location near airport, highway, industrial
- Economic decline in area
- Changing neighborhood character
- Environmental factors

**Always Incurable** (owner cannot fix):
- Beyond property boundaries
- Cannot be controlled by owner

**Example**: Beautiful home next to landfill

## Depreciation Calculations

### Straight-Line Depreciation (Age-Life Method)

**Formula**: **Depreciation = (Cost - Land Value) × (Effective Age ÷ Total Economic Life)**

**Example**:
- Replacement cost: $200,000
- Effective age: 10 years
- Economic life: 50 years
- Annual depreciation: $200,000 ÷ 50 = $4,000/year
- Total depreciation: $4,000 × 10 = **$40,000**

**Or**: $200,000 × (10 ÷ 50) = $200,000 × 0.20 = **$40,000**

### Effective Age vs. Actual Age

**Actual Age**: Years since built
**Effective Age**: Age based on condition
- Well-maintained may be younger
- Poorly maintained may be older

**Economic Life**: Total useful life of improvement

**Certified General**: All property types

---

## Practice Materials

### Common Math Problems:
- Sales comparison adjustments
- Cost approach calculations
- GRM calculations
- Cap rate problems
- Depreciation calculations
- NOI calculations

### Example Problems:

**Sales Comparison**:
- Comp: $250,000, has pool ($15,000)
- Subject has no pool
- Comp is better, subtract pool value
- Adjusted value: $250,000 - $15,000 = **$235,000**

**Income Approach**:
- NOI: $75,000
- Cap rate: 10%
- Value: $75,000 ÷ 0.10 = **$750,000**

**GRM**:
- Monthly rent: $1,800
- GRM: 150
- Value: $1,800 × 150 = **$270,000**

## Study Tips for Unit 16

1. **Master three approaches** - When each is used
2. **Understand comp adjustments** - CBS (Comp Better Subtract)
3. **Memorize income formulas** - V = I ÷ R
4. **Know depreciation types** - Physical, functional, external
5. **Practice calculations** - Each approach type

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Adjusting subject instead of comp in sales comparison
❌ Including mortgage payments in NOI
❌ Confusing GRM (monthly) with GIM (annual)
❌ Mixing up cap rate formula (I ÷ V vs. V ÷ I)
❌ Forgetting land value in cost approach
❌ Thinking all depreciation is curable

---

## Key Formulas

### Income Approach:
**Value = NOI ÷ Cap Rate (V = I ÷ R)**
**NOI = Value × Cap Rate (I = V × R)**
**Cap Rate = NOI ÷ Value (R = I ÷ V)**

### GRM:
**GRM = Sales Price ÷ Monthly Rent**
**Value = Monthly Rent × GRM**

### Cost Approach:
**Value = Land Value + (Replacement Cost - Depreciation)**

### Depreciation:
**Depreciation = Cost × (Effective Age ÷ Economic Life)**
