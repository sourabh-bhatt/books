## Key Concepts

### Real Property vs. Personal Property

**Real Property (Real Estate)**:
- Land and everything permanently attached to it
- Buildings and structures
- Trees and landscaping
- Fixtures
- Air rights and subsurface rights
- Immobile by nature

**Personal Property (Chattel)**:
- Movable items not attached to land
- Furniture, vehicles, equipment
- Can become real property when affixed (fixtures)

### The Bundle of Rights

Property ownership includes these rights:
1. **Right to Possess**: Use and occupy the property
2. **Right to Control**: Decide how property is used (within legal limits)
3. **Right to Enjoy**: Use property without interference
4. **Right to Exclude**: Keep others off the property
5. **Right to Dispose**: Sell, lease, or transfer the property

### Fixtures vs. Trade Fixtures

**Fixtures**: Personal property that becomes real property when attached
- Tests to determine if item is a fixture:
  - **Method of attachment**: How permanently is it attached?
  - **Adaptation**: Is it customized for the property?
  - **Relationship of parties**: What did parties intend?
  - **Agreement**: What does contract specify?

**Trade Fixtures**: Business equipment installed by tenant
- Remains personal property
- Tenant can remove before lease ends
- Examples: Restaurant equipment, store shelving

### Legal Characteristics of Real Property

**Physical Characteristics**:
1. **Immobility**: Land cannot be moved
2. **Indestructibility**: Land cannot be destroyed
3. **Uniqueness**: No two parcels are identical (nonhomogeneity)

**Economic Characteristics**:
1. **Scarcity**: Limited supply
2. **Improvements**: Buildings add value
3. **Permanence of investment**: Long-term nature
4. **Location (Situs)**: Most important factor in value

### Property Classifications

1. **Residential**: Single-family homes, condos, apartments
2. **Commercial**: Office buildings, retail stores, hotels
3. **Industrial**: Warehouses, factories, distribution centers
4. **Agricultural**: Farms, ranches, timberland
5. **Special Purpose**: Churches, schools, government buildings

### Land, Real Estate, and Real Property

**Land**: Earth's surface plus subsurface and air rights

**Real Estate**: Land plus permanent improvements

**Real Property**: Real estate plus bundle of rights

## Important Legal Concepts

### Subsurface Rights
- Ownership of minerals, oil, gas below surface
- Can be severed from surface rights
- Separate ownership possible

### Air Rights
- Ownership of space above property
- Limited by aircraft flight paths
- Can be sold separately (e.g., for building above)

### Water Rights
- **Riparian rights**: Property adjacent to flowing water
- **Littoral rights**: Property bordering lakes or oceans
- **Prior appropriation**: Rights based on first use (western states)
