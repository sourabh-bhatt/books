## Key Concepts

### Estates in Land

An **estate** is the degree, quantity, nature, and extent of interest a person has in real property.

### Freehold Estates (Ownership Estates)

#### 1. Fee Simple Absolute
- Highest form of ownership
- Unlimited duration
- Inheritable
- Most complete bundle of rights
- No conditions or limitations
- Estate continues forever

#### 2. Fee Simple Defeasible (Conditional Fee)
- Ownership with conditions
- If condition violated, property may revert
- Types:
  - **Fee simple determinable**: Automatically reverts if condition broken
  - **Fee simple subject to condition subsequent**: Grantor may take back if condition broken

#### 3. Life Estate
- Ownership for duration of someone's life
- **Life tenant**: Person who holds the life estate
- **Remainderman**: Person who inherits after life tenant dies
- **Reversionary interest**: Property returns to original owner
- Life tenant responsibilities:
  - Pay property taxes
  - Maintain property
  - Pay interest on mortgages
  - Cannot commit waste (damage to property)

### Leasehold Estates (Rental/Tenant Estates)

#### 1. Estate for Years (Fixed Term)
- Specific start and end dates
- Automatically expires at end date
- No notice required to terminate

#### 2. Periodic Estate (Estate from Period to Period)
- Continues for successive periods
- Automatically renews unless notice given
- Month-to-month or year-to-year
- Requires proper notice to terminate

#### 3. Estate at Will
- No specific term
- Can be terminated by either party at any time
- Requires notice (varies by state)

#### 4. Estate at Sufferance (Holdover Tenancy)
- Tenant stays after lease expires without permission
- Landlord can evict or accept rent (creating new lease)
- Lowest form of estate

## Encumbrances

An **encumbrance** is any claim, lien, charge, or liability that affects or limits the title to property.

### Types of Encumbrances

**1. Liens** (Financial Encumbrances)
- Monetary claims against property
- Covered in detail in Unit 15

**2. Physical Encumbrances** (Non-Financial)
- Easements
- Encroachments
- Deed restrictions
- Licenses

---

## Easements

An **easement** is the right to use another's land for a specific purpose.

### Types of Easements

#### By Use:
1. **Easement Appurtenant**
   - Benefits adjacent property
   - **Dominant tenement**: Property benefiting from easement
   - **Servient tenement**: Property burdened by easement
   - Runs with the land (transfers with property)
   - Example: Driveway across neighbor's land

2. **Easement in Gross**
   - Benefits individual or company, not property
   - Personal to holder
   - Example: Utility company power lines
   - May or may not transfer

#### By Method of Creation:
1. **Express Easement**: Created by written agreement
2. **Implied Easement**: Arises from circumstances (prior use, necessity)
3. **Easement by Necessity**: Required for property access
4. **Easement by Prescription**: Acquired through open, continuous use (like adverse possession)

### Termination of Easements
- Merger (both properties owned by same person)
- Release by easement holder
- Abandonment
- Non-use (prescription only)
- Destruction of servient tenement
- Court action

---

## Encroachments

**Encroachment**: Physical intrusion of one property onto another
- Building, fence, or structure crossing property line
- Can be discovered through survey
- May require legal action to remove
- Can ripen into easement by prescription if not addressed

---

## Deed Restrictions

**Private land use controls** placed in deeds
- Also called covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs)
- Run with the land (bind future owners)
- Examples:
  - Minimum house size
  - Architectural style requirements
  - Use restrictions
  - Setback requirements
- Enforced by property owners, not government

---

## License

**License**: Personal privilege to use land
- Permission to enter property for specific purpose
- Revocable at will
- Does not run with land
- Example: Ticket to sporting event, hunting permission
