**Pages:** (range not specified in analysis)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different forms of property ownership
- Learn the characteristics of various co-ownership types
- Distinguish between tenancy in common and joint tenancy
- Recognize ownership through trusts and corporations
- Understand community property and homestead rights

---

## Key Concepts

### Sole Ownership (Severalty)

**Ownership by one individual or entity**
- Complete control over property
- All rights belong to single owner
- Owner has full decision-making authority
- Can sell, lease, or mortgage without others' consent
- "Severalty" = severed from others

---

## Co-Ownership Forms

### 1. Tenancy in Common (TIC)

**Characteristics**:
- Two or more owners
- Each owns undivided fractional interest
- Interests can be unequal (e.g., 60%-40%)
- No right of survivorship
- Interest passes to heirs upon death
- Each owner can sell their interest independently
- New owner becomes tenant in common with others
- Default form of co-ownership in most states

**Example**: Three people own property - one owns 50%, two own 25% each

### 2. Joint Tenancy

**Characteristics**:
- Two or more owners
- **Right of survivorship**: When one dies, interest passes to surviving joint tenants
- Must have four unities (TTIP):
  - **Time**: Acquired at same time
  - **Title**: On same deed
  - **Interest**: Equal shares only
  - **Possession**: Equal rights to possess
- If any unity is broken, converts to tenancy in common
- Cannot will interest to heirs (survivorship prevails)
- Can be severed by sale (becomes TIC)

**Key Advantage**: Avoids probate (property passes directly to survivors)

### 3. Tenancy by the Entirety

**Characteristics**:
- **Only for married couples**
- Similar to joint tenancy with right of survivorship
- Requires fifth unity: Marriage
- Neither spouse can sell without other's consent
- Creditors of one spouse cannot attach property
- Divorce converts to tenancy in common
- Not available in all states

### 4. Community Property

**Available in community property states only** (e.g., CA, TX, AZ, NV, WA, ID, LA, NM, WI)

**Characteristics**:
- Property acquired during marriage belongs equally to both spouses
- Each spouse owns 50% undivided interest
- Separate property: Owned before marriage or acquired by gift/inheritance
- Either spouse can will their half
- Death of spouse: Half goes per will, half remains with surviving spouse

**Community Property with Right of Survivorship**: Hybrid allowing survivorship

---

## Business Ownership Forms

### 1. Partnerships

**General Partnership**:
- Two or more persons co-own business
- All partners have management rights
- All partners personally liable for debts
- Partnership itself can own real estate

**Limited Partnership**:
- General partners: Manage and have unlimited liability
- Limited partners: Invest only, liability limited to investment
- Often used for real estate investments

### 2. Corporations
