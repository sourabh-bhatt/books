## Learning Objectives

- Understand the three main methods of legal property description
- Learn how to read and interpret metes and bounds descriptions
- Understand the government (rectangular) survey system
- Recognize lot and block (recorded plat) descriptions
- Calculate property areas using different description methods

---

## Key Concepts

### Purpose of Legal Descriptions

A legal description must:
- **Uniquely identify** the property
- Be **precise and unambiguous**
- Allow property to be **located and surveyed**
- Stand the test of time
- Be acceptable in court

**NOT acceptable legal descriptions**:
- Street addresses
- Tax assessor parcel numbers (alone)
- Names of property owners

---

## Three Main Description Systems

### 1. Metes and Bounds

**"Metes" = distances, "Bounds" = directions**

**Characteristics**:
- Oldest method
- Uses physical features and measurements
- Starts at **point of beginning (POB)**
- Follows boundary lines with directions and distances
- Returns to point of beginning (forms closed polygon)
- Common in original 13 colonies and Texas

**Components**:
- **Point of beginning (POB)**: Starting point
- **Monuments**: Fixed reference points (natural or artificial)
  - Natural: Trees, rocks, streams
  - Artificial: Stakes, markers, iron pins
- **Courses**: Compass directions (bearings)
- **Distances**: Linear measurements (feet, yards, rods)

**Example**:
"Beginning at the iron stake at the intersection of Oak Road and Main Street, thence North 45° East 200 feet, thence South 45° East 150 feet, thence South 45° West 200 feet, thence North 45° West 150 feet to the point of beginning."

**Problems**:
- Monuments can be destroyed or moved
- Permanent monuments preferred over temporary ones
- Natural monuments take precedence over measurements

### 2. Government (Rectangular) Survey System

Also called: **U.S. Public Land Survey System (PLSS)**

**Used in**: 30 states (primarily Midwest and West, not original colonies, TX, or HI)

**Key Components**:

#### Principal Meridians and Base Lines
- **Principal meridian**: North-south line
- **Base line**: East-west line
- Intersect at **initial point**
- 36 principal meridians in U.S.

#### Townships
- Created by township lines (east-west) and range lines (north-south)
- Each township is **6 miles × 6 miles** (36 square miles)
- Numbered by location:
  - **Township (Tier)**: North or South of base line
  - **Range**: East or West of principal meridian
- Example: "T3N, R2E" = Township 3 North, Range 2 East

#### Sections
- Each township divided into **36 sections**
- Each section = **1 mile × 1 mile** = **640 acres**
- Sections numbered 1-36 in serpentine pattern:
  - Start top right (NE corner) with Section 1
  - Go left across top row
  - Snake back and forth
  - End bottom right (SE corner) with Section 36

**Section Numbering Pattern**:
```
6   5   4   3   2   1
7   8   9   10  11  12
18  17  16  15  14  13
19  20  21  22  23  24
30  29  28  27  26  25
31  32  33  34  35  36
```

#### Fractional Sections
Sections divided into:
- Halves (320 acres)
- Quarters (160 acres)
- Quarter-quarters (40 acres)
- Smallest unit typically: 10 acres

**Description reads backwards** (right to left):
- "SW¼ of NE¼ of Section 12" means:
  - Start with Section 12
  - Find NE quarter (160 acres)
  - Find SW quarter of that (40 acres)

**Area Calculations**:
- Section = 640 acres
- ½ section = 320 acres
- ¼ section = 160 acres
- ¼ of ¼ = 40 acres
- Formula: 640 ÷ denominator of all fractions

**Examples**:
- NW¼ = 640 ÷ 4 = 160 acres
- S½ of SE¼ = 640 ÷ 2 ÷ 4 = 80 acres
- NE¼ of SW¼ of NW¼ = 640 ÷ 4 ÷ 4 ÷ 4 = 10 acres

### 3. Lot and Block (Recorded Plat)

Also called: **Subdivision plat**

**Characteristics**:
- Used in subdivisions
- References recorded plat map
- Most common in developed areas
- Simplest method to use

**Components**:
- **Lot number**
- **Block number** (if applicable)
- **Subdivision name**
- **County and state**
- **Plat book and page number**

**Example**:
"Lot 15, Block 3, Meadowview Subdivision, as recorded in Plat Book 12, Page 45, County Records, Cook County, Illinois"

**Plat (subdivision plan) must include**:
- Lot dimensions and boundaries
- Streets and easements
- Lot and block numbers
- Surveyor's certification
- Dedication to public use (streets, parks)

**Recorded where**: County recorder's office

## Additional Description Elements

### Reference to Surveys
- Monuments and markers
- Professional land survey
- Survey stakes and iron pins

### Datum
- Reference point for elevation measurements
- Mean sea level commonly used
- Important for determining elevation

### Benchmarks
- Permanent reference points for surveyors
- Established by U.S. Geological Survey
- Used to ensure accuracy

---

## Measurement Conversions

### Linear Measurements
- 1 mile = 5,280 feet
- 1 rod = 16.5 feet
- 1 chain = 66 feet
- 1 yard = 3 feet

### Area Measurements
- 1 acre = 43,560 square feet
- 1 section = 640 acres = 1 square mile
- 1 township = 36 sections = 36 square miles

### Conversions
- Square feet ÷ 43,560 = Acres
- Acres × 43,560 = Square feet

---

## Practice Materials

### Common Math Problems
1. Calculate acres from section fractions
2. Convert square feet to acres
3. Calculate perimeter and area
4. Identify section locations

### Question Types
- Matching: Description methods and characteristics
- True/False: System applications
- Multiple Choice: Calculations and interpretations

## Study Tips for Unit 5

1. **Memorize key numbers**:
   - 1 section = 640 acres
   - 1 acre = 43,560 sq ft
   - 1 township = 36 sections
   - Township = 6 miles × 6 miles

2. **Practice section calculations** - Work backwards through fractions

3. **Learn section numbering** - Draw the serpentine pattern

4. **Understand which system is used where** - Geographic knowledge

5. **Practice reading descriptions backwards** - Government survey descriptions

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Reading government descriptions left to right (read RIGHT to LEFT!)
❌ Forgetting section numbering serpentine pattern
❌ Confusing township (6×6 miles) with section (1×1 mile)
❌ Using street addresses as legal descriptions
❌ Multiplying instead of dividing when calculating acres from fractions

---

## Key Formulas

### Area of Government Survey Parcels
**Formula**: 640 ÷ (all denominators multiplied)

**Examples**:
- N½ = 640 ÷ 2 = **320 acres**
- W½ of E½ = 640 ÷ 2 ÷ 2 = **160 acres**
- SE¼ of NW¼ = 640 ÷ 4 ÷ 4 = **40 acres**
- N½ of SW¼ of SE¼ = 640 ÷ 2 ÷ 4 ÷ 4 = **20 acres**

### Area Conversions
- **Square feet to acres**: Sq ft ÷ 43,560
- **Acres to square feet**: Acres × 43,560

### Perimeter and Area
- **Rectangle area**: Length × Width
- **Rectangle perimeter**: 2(Length + Width)
- **Triangle area**: (Base × Height) ÷ 2

## Quick Reference

### Section Facts
- 1 section = 1 mile × 1 mile = 640 acres
