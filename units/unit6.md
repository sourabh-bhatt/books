## Types of Deeds

### 1. General Warranty Deed

**Highest level of protection for grantee**

**Grantor's covenants (promises)**:
1. **Covenant of seisin**: Grantor owns property and has right to convey
2. **Covenant against encumbrances**: No undisclosed liens or easements
3. **Covenant of quiet enjoyment**: Title will not be challenged
4. **Covenant of further assurance**: Grantor will fix title defects
5. **Covenant of warranty forever**: Grantor defends against all claims

**Protection period**: Covers all time, past and present

**Use**: Most common in sales to buyers

### 2. Special Warranty Deed
