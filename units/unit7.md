## Key Concepts

### The Recording System

**Purpose of Recording**:
- Provide public notice of ownership
- Establish priority of claims
- Create permanent record
- Protect property rights
- Prevent fraud

**What Can Be Recorded**:
- Deeds
- Mortgages/deeds of trust
- Liens
- Easements
- Long-term leases
- Options
- Court judgments

**Where Recorded**: County recorder's office (or register of deeds)

**Recording Process**:
1. Document presented to recorder
2. Acknowledged (notarized)
3. Document copied/scanned
4. Indexed by grantor and grantee names
5. Original returned to owner
6. Copy kept in public records

---

## Constructive Notice

**Constructive Notice** (Legal Notice):
- Information available through public records
- People are assumed to know what's in public records
- Recording provides constructive notice to world
- "Should have known" even if didn't actually check

**Actual Notice**:
- Direct knowledge
- Personal inspection
- Being told about something

**Inquiry Notice**:
- Duty to investigate when facts suggest further inquiry needed
- Example: Seeing someone living on property

---

## Priority of Interests

**General Rule**: "First in time, first in right"
- Properly recorded documents have priority by date/time of recording
- Unrecorded documents have no priority against subsequent purchasers

**Exceptions**:
- Property tax liens (always priority)
- Special assessment liens
- Mechanic's liens (relate back to start of work)

---

## Chain of Title

**Chain of Title**: History of all owners and conveyances affecting the property

**Components**:
- Every deed transferring property
- All liens, encumbrances, easements
- Court actions affecting title
- Shows continuous succession of ownership

**Purpose**:
- Verify current owner has valid title
- Identify all claims against property
- Establish marketable title

**Links in Chain**:
- Each transfer is a "link"
- Broken link = title defect
- Missing deed = gap in chain

---

## Title Search

**Title Search**: Examination of public records to determine status of title

**Process**:
1. Search public records going back (typically) 40-60 years
2. Trace all owners from present back to original grant
3. Check for liens, judgments, encumbrances
4. Verify legal descriptions match
5. Check for breaks in chain

**Who Performs**:
- Title company employees
- Attorneys (in some states)
- Professional abstractors

**Time Period**: Varies by state and custom (40-60 years typical)

---

## Evidence of Title

### 1. Abstract of Title

**Abstract**: Condensed history of title showing all recorded documents

**Contents**:
- Summary of each document in chain
- Dates, parties, legal descriptions
- Liens and encumbrances
- Does NOT guarantee title
- Attorney provides opinion based on abstract

**Attorney's Opinion**:
- Review of abstract
- Legal conclusion about title status
- Identifies defects or "clouds"

**Advantages**:
- Comprehensive history
- Can be updated for future sales

**Disadvantages**:
- No financial protection
- Attorney opinion not a guarantee
- Errors possible in search or opinion

### 2. Title Insurance

**Title Insurance Policy**: Contract protecting against title defects

**Characteristics**:
- **One-time premium** (paid at closing)
- **Protects against past defects** (not future)
- **Pays claims and legal fees** for covered defects
- **Lasts as long as insured has interest**

**Two Types of Policies**:

**Owner's Policy (Buyer's Policy)**:
- Protects property owner
- Amount = purchase price
- Lasts as long as owner or heirs have interest
- Premium paid by seller or buyer (varies by location)

**Lender's Policy (Mortgagee's Policy)**:
- Protects mortgage lender
- Amount = loan balance (decreases as loan paid)
- Required by lenders
- Premium paid by borrower
- Expires when loan paid off

**Coverage**:
- Forgery and fraud
- Errors in public records
- Undisclosed heirs
- Invalid deeds
- Errors in title search

**Exclusions** (Not Covered):
- Defects known to buyer
- Zoning violations
- Defects created after policy date
- Environmental liens (sometimes)
- Easements and liens shown in policy

**Title Commitment (Binder)**:
- Preliminary report
- Issued before closing
- Shows conditions for issuing policy
- Lists exceptions to coverage

### 3. Torrens System

**Registered Title System**:
- Government certifies title
- Court registration required
- Certificate of title issued
- Used in few states

**Characteristics**:
- Original registration requires court action
- Certificate shows current owner and encumbrances
- Transfer updates certificate
- Government guarantees title
- Rare in U.S.

---

## Marketable Title

**Marketable Title**: Title free from reasonable doubt and defects

**Requirements**:
- Valid chain of title
- No gaps or breaks
- Free from serious defects
- No undisclosed encumbrances
- Courts would compel buyer to accept

**Not Required to be**:
- Perfect title (minor defects acceptable)
- Free from all encumbrances (disclosed ones OK)

**Unmarketable Title Causes**:
- Breaks in chain of title
- Forgery in chain
- Undisclosed liens
- Incorrect legal descriptions
- Missing signatures
- Spousal rights not released

---

## Title Issues and Remedies

### Clouds on Title

**Cloud**: Claim or encumbrance that impairs title

**Examples**:
- Old mortgage not released
- Judgment lien
- Undisclosed heir claim
- Easement dispute

**Remedy**: Quiet title action (lawsuit to clear title)

### Title Defects

**Defect**: Any problem impairing title validity

**Common Defects**:
- Forged documents
- Incompetent grantors
- Missing heirs
- Improper legal descriptions
- Liens and judgments

### Suit to Quiet Title

**Purpose**: Court action to remove cloud and establish clear title

**Process**:
- Lawsuit filed by property owner
- All potential claimants notified
- Court hearing held
- Judge rules on validity of title
- Court order removes cloud

❌ Thinking title insurance covers future defects (only past)
❌ Mixing up owner's and lender's policies

❌ Assuming marketable title must be perfect (minor defects OK)
